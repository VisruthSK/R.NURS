# R.NURS

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

A Base R, simple implementation of the No-Underrun Sampler. This implementation aims to mostly directly implement the algorithm as described by the paper, with at most small changes for code aesthetics and performance. This version uses the memory saving technique described in section 2.2.

## Installation

You can install the development version of R.NURS from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("VisruthSK/R.NURS")
```

## Example: Neal's Funnel

```{r funnel}
library(R.NURS)
library(ggplot2)

set.seed(0)
logpdf_funnel <- function(theta) {
  y <- theta[1]
  dnorm(y, 0, 3, log = TRUE) + sum(dnorm(theta[-1], 0, exp(y / 2), log = TRUE))
}

samples <- NURS(
  logpdf_funnel,
  theta_init = rep(0, 15),
  n = 5000,
  epsilon = 0.1,
  h = 0.5,
  M = 5
)

data.frame(y = samples[, 1], x1 = samples[, 2]) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = y, y = x1)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.3) +
  theme_minimal()
```
